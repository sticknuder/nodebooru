<p>Nodebooru is an image board for Stick Nodes related content inspired by services such as Danbooru,
Gelbooru, and Moebooru. It runs on the open source image board engine Szurubooru.</p>

<p class='section'><strong>Upload Policy<strong></p>

<p>The purpose of booru sites is to amass content by allowing any user to 
upload content (even the content of other artists). For this reason, it would 
be extremely difficult to check whether uploaders have permission for every 
single post. Therefore, we enact a strong retroactive policy instead.</p>

<p>If you are an artist who would like your works removed from the site, 
please contact the site admin at either thiccnoder@gmail.com or @sticknuder 
on Discord. Your works will be removed promptly.</p>

<p class='section'><strong>Registration</strong></p>

<p>The e-mail you enter during account creation is only used to retrieve your
Gravatar and for password reminders. Only you can see it (well, except the
database staff&hellip; we won&rsquo;t spam your mailbox anyway).</p>

<p>Oh, and you can delete your account at any time. Posts you uploaded will
stay, unless some angry admin removes them.</p>
