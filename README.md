# nodebooru

Nodebooru is a fork of Szurubooru.

If anyone in the future reading this is thinking about cherry-picking commits for any reason (not that I think I will add any features worth cherry-picking), make sure to check the commit's file changes because there are probably times where I edit things other than what the main point of the commit is (for example making Nodebooru specific tweaks to the client). I know this is bad practice, but I'm just warning you.
